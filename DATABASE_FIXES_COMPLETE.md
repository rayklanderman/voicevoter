## Issues Fixed

- Added `question_id` column to trending_topics table for proper relationships
- Updated all existing questions to be active by default

### 3. ‚úÖ Query Join Failures (400 errors)

**Problem:** Supabase queries failing with 400 status when joining trending_topics with questions
**Solution:**

- Fixed the foreign key relationship between trending_topics and questions
- Created proper bidirectional relationships
- Ensured all trending topics have corresponding question records

### 4. ‚úÖ Question Creation Conflicts (409 errors)
