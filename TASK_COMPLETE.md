# VoiceVoter - Task Complete! 🎉

## Summary

All database relationship and constraint issues have been successfully resolved. The app is now fully functional and deployed to production.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Issues

- **Fixed foreign key constraints** between `questions`, `trending_topics`, and `votes` tables
- **Added missing columns**: `is_active` to questions, `question_id` to trending_topics

### 2. Unique Constraint Issues

- **Fixed duplicate vote prevention** with proper unique constraints on session_id and user_id combinations
- **Resolved 23505 errors** by implementing unique session IDs for test data

- **Updated all RLS policies** for questions, votes, trending_topics, and trend_votes
