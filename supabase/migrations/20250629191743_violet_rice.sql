/*
  # Voice Voter Database Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `questions`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `text` (text, not null)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    - `votes`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `question_id` (uuid, foreign key to questions)
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
      - `choice` (text, 'yes' or 'no')
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - Unique constraint on (question_id, user_id)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on both tables
    - Allow anyone to read questions and votes
    - Only authenticated users can insert votes
    - Users can only vote with their own user_id

  3. Performance
    - Indexes on frequently queried columns
    - Sample questions for testing
